# About

Decision making is difficult, especially when there are many different alternatives and criteria to base the decision on.

Plought is a collection of decision making applications. Each app uses different methods to evaluate alternatives against each other. Plought aims to reduce [noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise:_A_Flaw_in_Human_Judgment#:~:text=The%20book%20concerns%20'noise'%20in,psychological%20perspectives%20of%20the%20issue.) in decision making by encouraging independent judgement, and reducing subjectivity.

While Plought can help guide in decision making, and reveal surprising results, many decisions are subjective (including inputs into the application). It is hard to be able to accurately account for each possible alternative and criteria. Use Plought as a tool, ultimately the decision is up to you!

```ts
console.log("hello");
```
